## Progressive Enhancement
As firm believers in progressive enhancement, we rely on log files, then client hints, and lastly Javascript for our data collection.

## Data Ingest
We perform an immediate write to short term storage and carry out sanitization and
processing later on.

## Dashboard
Provide a written explanation of your design decisions (which chart types you chose for which data, what metrics you decided to display and why, etc). Be thorough in your explanation to demonstrate to the teaching team that you explored your options and made your decisions based on legitimate reasoning and user centered thinking.
